# ArcGIS_Tools
Useful ArcGIS script tools that seem like they should exist already but don't. So I made them.

To use the latest version of the tools, download the .tbx file and the corresponding python script. Then use ArcCatalog to open the properties of the script in the toolbox and make sure the tool is pointing to the python script.
